#Feature:Verify Complex get data
#Scenario: Verify GET operation for complex data
    #Given I perform authentication operation for "/auth/login" with body
      #| email              | password  |
      #| techie@email.com   | techie    |
    #And I perform GET operation with path parameter for address "/location/"
      #| id |
      #| 1  |
    #Then I should see the street name as "1st street" for the "primary" address
